# todo

add support for various images to render text on
- create rams and academy templates where i only add text! :-D

write script that checks for new files in vault (with a certain flag), and
- processes them to generate collaterals from the text
    - figure out good prompts
- suggests collaterals to me for approval (when, how do I get noticed)
- posts them to the scheduler table and gdrive
- need to set up 3 tabs in the scheduler GSheet for each channel LI, FB, IG

put text info and direct link in scheduler table
- standard text at first: standard links
- then configurable text specific to each collateral
- work on (json) format to use in the .md files for finer control

# next


fix usage of app from shell command 
- export to drive does not seem to work: app hangs, no logs, no errors
- maybe start over with generating a shell script that retrieves the file, not just the file content
