# todo

add support for various images to render text on
- create rams and academy templates where i only add text! :-D

write script that checks for new files in vault (with a certain flag), and
- processes them to generate collaterals from the text
    - figure out good prompts
- suggests collaterals to me for approval (when, how do I get noticed)
- posts them to the scheduler table and gdrive
- need to set up 3 tabs in the scheduler GSheet for each channel LI, FB, IG

put text info and direct link in scheduler table
- standard text at first: standard links
- then configurable text specific to each collateral
- work on (json) format to use in the .md files for finer control


# next

create a file (json) that includes all texts where the image has been approved/saved. 
- purpose: finetuning good prompt results
- put in file ending in "-goodresponses.md"
